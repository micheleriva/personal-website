title: The frustration of being a self taught developer
---

I've started my software engineering career by chance. \
I've studied a bunch of **HTML**, **CSS**, **ActionScript** and **PHP** at high school, and I started to make websites as an hobby, without even asking for a revenue.

During my last high school year, I did an internship in a creative/web agency, and my life changed forever.

During the last seven years, I had the opportunity to grow a lot, trying different programming paradigms (imperative/OOP/FP) and languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, Elixir, Go, Haskell, ReasonML).

I also wrote code for some big companies and foundations (Facebook, Linux Foundation, Apache Foundation, Maserati, ViacomCBS).

I can create a complex realtime and distributed system on my own. \
I can design its architecture and write its backend code using a microservices architecture. \
I can develop its frontend using React, Vue, Svelte, SASS, Stylus, Less or just plain CSS. \
I can setup a CI/CD process and deploy that application on AWS, DigitalOcean or somewhere else.

I'm not saying that I am the best developer at writing architecture or backend code. \
I'm not the best developer for writing frontend code. \
I'm not the best devops engineer.

I just can do it, because I love to do that, just like any other developer.

## Biggest tech companies will never want to hire me
That's a fact. \
**FANG** companies (**F**acebook, **A**mazon, **N**etflix, **G**oogle, just to name few) won't never be interested in hiring someone like me, just because I'm not a **specialist**

I love the "[On being a generalist](https://flaviocopes.com/generalist)" article from **Flavio Copes**, 'cause he described exactly my thoughts about that topic:

> _You’re a specialist if you’re a developer focusing on React and you just do that. You even call yourself “React developer”. <br /> You’re a generalist if you know and use React, but also know Vue, you can design a page in Figma and translate that design into a React component with CSS. Plus, you also know how to deploy an application to Heroku._

I highly recommend to read that article in order to understand what I mean.

The problem is that big tech companies doesn't really care about "**generalists**". \
Let's say that I want to apply for a position at **Google**. \
During the interview process, I may be asked to solve some [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) problems, just to show my knowledge about algorithms and data structures.

But guess what? I have a very little knowledge about that.

That's because 99% of the time, in 2020 you're developing REST/GraphQL APIs and some other similar stuff, that doesn't really require a computer science degree (in web development, of course). \
At time of writing, I have 7+ years of experience in professional software development, and guess how many times I had to choose between two different sorting algorithms? What about choosing between two different data structures? \

I'm not saying that learning **DSA** (data structures and algorithms) is completely useless. I'm just saying that **there are a lot of great developers that can do their jobs searching on Google for DSA**. \
And nice fact: after years of professional software development, it will be incredibly easy for developers to learn those algorithms/data structures. \

Avoiding to hire devs just because of lack of knowledge about **DSA** is just stupid. \
Developers should be hired for their attitude, curiosity, commitment and passion.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.</p>&mdash; Max Howell (@mxcl) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**FANG**-like companies doesn't really care if you are a fullstack developer. They just want you to be an expert in that given language and nothing more. You must be an expert in **DSA** because they just want to say that "they hire the best developers".

Guess what? \
I've met some amazing developers in the companies I've worked for, and **FANG** companies will never benefit from such great people.

By the way, I think I will never apply to one of those companies, 'cause I perfectly know that my experience doesn't really mean anything to them and I would be rejected after a 10 minutes call because of what I wrote above.

## It is harder to get some information
Since I started to learn **React.js** back in 2014, I've started to get attracted by the **Functional Programming** paradigm. \
While coding **FP** in JS/TS/Elixir can be extremely easy, writing correct **FP** code in **Haskell** or **OCaml** can be really challenging. \
Coding **Haskell** software without an academic background is hard, and all those "learn Haskell in one month" books doesn't really help. \

As I said before, without a proper academic background, it is harder for a self taught developer to understand which data structure or algorithm should be used and why.

An year ago I was writing a small Redis implementation in Node.js, and I needed a fast way to store and retrieve data in vanilla JS. It took some time to understand why the **HashMap** data structure could be the right choice for that task.

Same when I wanted to build my whole blockchain just for fun. I've never studied linked lists or Merkle trees, but after some research, I finally found out the answers to all of my questions.

Yes, it might be harder for us self taught developers to get access to some information. \
But it doesn't mean that we can't do it.

## Some companies just want a degree
I won't spend much time on that. \
During my professional career I've leaded a team of CS degreed developer and they didn't even know that I don't have any degree. \

Guys, now you know.

Some consultancy companies just want developers with a CS degree just to tell their customers: "Hey, I'm putting a team of 10 Software Engineers with a CS degree for your project". That happens a lot, but again, especially in web development that doesn't really make a difference.

CS degree should be something useful for you as a person/professional, not for the company. \
As a developer, you can always achieve the same results of a graduate engineer. Maybe it will be harder (and yes, for me it is way harder some times), but you can do it.

## Impostor syndrome and burnout

That's the worst part of being a self taught developer. \
I'd summarize my thoughts with a **Neil deGrasse Tyson** quote:

> _As areas of knowledge grow, so too do the perimeter of ignorance_

And that's absolutely true. \
The more I dig into a topic, language, paradigm, the less I feel I know about it.

That's maybe because as a self taught developer, I don't know what's next.

"Oh great! So in order to print something to the console in Haskell I need to use the `IO()` monad!" \
"Well, but what is a monad actually?" \
"A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, of course!" \
"Awesome, what is an endofunctor?" \
"It's basically a functor from one category back to the same category" \
"Cool, and wtf is a functor?" \
"A functor is a map between categories" \
"...ok but wtf is a category actually"

and so on.

Maybe some developers doesn't really care about that. \
But from my point of view, I feel "incomplete" without deeply understand what I'm doing. \
Ok, I can print a string to the console in Haskell, awesome. But why should I wrap it into a monad? \
Why is everything becoming so complicated? \
Every time I discover something new, a new world seems to appear in front of me, and I have to explore it. \

This makes me feel so ignorant. \
And if I'm ignorant there's no reason why I should work for X company. \
Other developers are way smarter than me, because they seems to know everything. \
I fear to loose my job because I'm not like the other developers. \
I'm doing something so easy, that everyone could do it.

These are some of the most common thoughts that a self taught developer can have when he/she's stuck with a problem, when he/she discovers something new and unexpected, or just when they read some amazing blog posts or open source software from other developers.

That leads to the burnout, which I actually experienced once and has been terrible. \
I had to take two week of holidays because I didn't want to code anymore. \
I deleted most of my local repositories (thanks ~~God~~ **Linus** there's Git), I didn't touch my computer for days and I just wanted to quit my job. \
On the other hand, I also feared to loose my job because of my incompetence and my inability to get out of this bad situation.

That has been quite terrifying.

I think that impostor syndrome is something that many developers are facing every day (even the CS-degreed ones), and I know that sometimes I can go a little overboard. \
Computer Science is a very competitive field, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one experiencing this.


By the way, there's something I didn't mentioned yet in this post. \
I may seem a bit critic about the software development industry, but that's not the purpose of this blog article. \
Software development is a really complex job that can give great satisfactions to the ones that are doing it with passion. \
Every time that I feel frustrated I try to look back and see how many things I did and how much I enjoyed doing them. \
I can't see myself doing another job.

I love to create things with code, 'cause code is freedom.
