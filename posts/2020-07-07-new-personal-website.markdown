title: New Personal Website!
---

After about one year, I finally decided to get rid of my old website. <br />
The fact is that I don't need a cool website full of animations and interactions. <br />
I just want something where I can write about my thoughts, career and personal stuff.

## Goodbye CSS
Don't get me wrong, I like CSS. I also like **styled-components**, **cssinjs** and other great stuff from the JS community, but I don't need it. <br />
This website is about its content and nothing more.

## Goodbye JS
As a Node.js contributor, I can say that I know a bit of JavaScript, but guess what? I won't put it inside this website. <br />
This website will just be written using markdown and a bit of Haskell. <br />
