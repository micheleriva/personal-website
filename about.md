title: About
---

I’m a passionate and experienced software engineer from Milan, Italy.
I’ve been working as a software engineer for 7+ years in both product and consultancy companies, taking the best from both worlds.

During the last years, I have contributed to a lot of open source projects from companies and foundations such as **Facebook**, **Uber**, **Maserati**, **Apache Foundation**, **Linux Foundation** and so on.
I’ve also written dozens of public domains articles about computer science, performance enhancements, scalability, clean code and many other topics. You can find them here: [www.hackdoor.io/users/micheleriva](https://www.hackdoor.io/users/micheleriva)

I’m a fast learner. I love to learn new programming languages and paradigms in order to build high quality software with them.

I’m currently coding in **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Go** and **Elixir**, but I’d love to learn other programming languages to write programs in. \
In the past years I’ve also had the opportunity to code in **PHP**, **Ruby**, **Python** and other languages.

I also like to write frontend applications using **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte** or just **vanilla JS** and **CSS**.

I’m currently working as a **Senior Software Engineer** at [ViacomCBS](https://www.viacomcbs.com), where I’m building a multi-tenant **Node.js** **SSR/React** application at the heart of our streaming websites and networks.
