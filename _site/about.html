            <h1>About</h1>

<p>During the last years, I have contributed to a lot of open source projects from companies and foundations such as <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Uber</strong>, <strong>Apache Foundation</strong>, <strong>Linux Foundation</strong> and so on. I’ve also written dozens of public domains articles about computer science, performance enhancements, scalability, clean code and many other topics.

<p>I’m a fast learner. I love to learn new programming languages and paradigms in order to build high quality software with them.</p>
<p>I’m currently coding in <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>Elixir</strong>, but I’d love to learn other programming languages to write programs in In the past years I’ve also had the opportunity to code in <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and other languages.</p>
<p>I also like to write frontend applications using <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Vue</strong>, <strong>Svelte</strong> or just <strong>vanilla JS</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m currently working as a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> at <a href="https://www.viacomcbs.com">ViacomCBS</a>, where I’m building a multi-tenant <strong>Node.js</strong> <strong>SSR/React</strong> application at the heart of our streaming websites and networks.</p>
