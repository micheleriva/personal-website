    <section>
        <p>I’ve started my software engineering career by chance.<br />
I’ve studied a bunch of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>ActionScript</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong> at high school, and I started to make websites as an hobby, without even asking for a revenue.</p>
<p>During my last high school year, I did an internship in a creative/web agency, and my life changed forever.</p>
<p>During the last seven years, I had the opportunity to grow a lot, trying different programming paradigms (imperative/OOP/FP) and languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, Elixir, Go, Haskell, ReasonML).</p>
<p>I also wrote code for some big companies and foundations (Facebook, Linux Foundation, Apache Foundation, Maserati, ViacomCBS).</p>
<p>I can create a complex realtime and distributed system on my own.<br />
I can design its architecture and write its backend code using a microservices architecture.<br />
I can develop its frontend using React, Vue, Svelte, SASS, Stylus, Less or just plain CSS.<br />
I can setup a CI/CD process and deploy that application on AWS, DigitalOcean or somewhere else.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that I am the best developer at writing architecture or backend code.<br />
I’m not the best developer for writing frontend code.<br />
I’m not the best devops engineer.</p>
<p>I just can do it, because I love to do that, just like any other developer.</p>
<h2 id="biggest-tech-companies-will-never-want-to-hire-me">Biggest tech companies will never want to hire me</h2>
<p>That’s a fact.<br />
<strong>FANG</strong> companies (<strong>F</strong>acebook, <strong>A</strong>mazon, <strong>N</strong>etflix, <strong>G</strong>oogle, just to name few) won’t never be interested in hiring someone like me, just because I’m not a <strong>specialist</strong></p>
<p>I love the “<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/generalist">On being a generalist</a>” article from <strong>Flavio Copes</strong>, ’cause he described exactly my thoughts about that topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You’re a specialist if you’re a developer focusing on React and you just do that. You even call yourself “React developer”. <br /> You’re a generalist if you know and use React, but also know Vue, you can design a page in Figma and translate that design into a React component with CSS. Plus, you also know how to deploy an application to Heroku.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend to read that article in order to understand what I mean.</p>
<p>The problem is that big tech companies doesn’t really care about “<strong>generalists</strong>”.<br />
Let’s say that I want to apply for a position at <strong>Google</strong>.<br />
During the interview process, I may be asked to solve some <a href="https://leetcode.com">Leetcode</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a> problems, just to show my knowledge about algorithms and data structures.</p>
<p>But guess what? I have a very little knowledge about that.</p>
<p>That’s because 99% of the time, in 2020 you’re developing REST/GraphQL APIs and some other similar stuff, that doesn’t really require a computer science degree (in web development, of course).<br />
At time of writing, I have 7+ years of experience in professional software development, and guess how many times I had to choose between two different sorting algorithms? What about choosing between two different data structures?<br />
</p>
<p>I’m not saying that learning <strong>DSA</strong> (data structures and algorithms) is completely useless. I’m just saying that <strong>there are a lot of great developers that can do their jobs searching on Google for DSA</strong>.<br />
And nice fact: after years of professional software development, it will be incredibly easy for developers to learn those algorithms/data structures.<br />
</p>
<p>Avoiding to hire devs just because of lack of knowledge about <strong>DSA</strong> is just stupid.<br />
Developers should be hired for their attitude, curiosity, commitment and passion.</p>

<p><strong>FANG</strong>-like companies doesn’t really care if you are a fullstack developer. They just want you to be an expert in that given language and nothing more. You must be an expert in <strong>DSA</strong> because they just want to say that “they hire the best developers”.</p>
<p>Guess what?<br />
I’ve met some amazing developers in the companies I’ve worked for, and <strong>FANG</strong> companies will never benefit from such great people.</p>
<p>By the way, I think I will never apply to one of those companies, ’cause I perfectly know that my experience doesn’t really mean anything to them and I would be rejected after a 10 minutes call because of what I wrote above.</p>
<h2 id="it-is-harder-to-get-some-information">It is harder to get some information</h2>
<p>Since I started to learn <strong>React.js</strong> back in 2014, I’ve started to get attracted by the <strong>Functional Programming</strong> paradigm.<br />
While coding <strong>FP</strong> in JS/TS/Elixir can be extremely easy, writing correct <strong>FP</strong> code in <strong>Haskell</strong> or <strong>OCaml</strong> can be really challenging.<br />
Coding <strong>Haskell</strong> software without an academic background is hard, and all those “learn Haskell in one month” books doesn’t really help.<br />
</p>
<p>As I said before, without a proper academic background, it is harder for a self taught developer to understand which data structure or algorithm should be used and why.</p>
<p>An year ago I was writing a small Redis implementation in Node.js, and I needed a fast way to store and retrieve data in vanilla JS. It took some time to understand why the <strong>HashMap</strong> data structure could be the right choice for that task.</p>
<p>Same when I wanted to build my whole blockchain just for fun. I’ve never studied linked lists or Merkle trees, but after some research, I finally found out the answers to all of my questions.</p>
<p>Yes, it might be harder for us self taught developers to get access to some information.<br />
But it doesn’t mean that we can’t do it.</p>
<h2 id="some-companies-just-want-a-degree">Some companies just want a degree</h2>
<p>I won’t spend much time on that.<br />
During my professional career I’ve leaded a team of CS degreed developer and they didn’t even know that I don’t have any degree.<br />
</p>
<p>Guys, now you know.</p>
<p>Some consultancy companies just want developers with a CS degree just to tell their customers: “Hey, I’m putting a team of 10 Software Engineers with a CS degree for your project”. That happens a lot, but again, especially in web development that doesn’t really make a difference.</p>
<p>CS degree should be something useful for you as a person/professional, not for the company.<br />
As a developer, you can always achieve the same results of a graduate engineer. Maybe it will be harder (and yes, for me it is way harder some times), but you can do it.</p>
<h2 id="impostor-syndrome-and-burnout">Impostor syndrome and burnout</h2>
<p>That’s the worst part of being a self taught developer.<br />
I’d summarize my thoughts with a <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong> quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As areas of knowledge grow, so too do the perimeter of ignorance</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s absolutely true.<br />
The more I dig into a topic, language, paradigm, the less I feel I know about it.</p>
<p>That’s maybe because as a self taught developer, I don’t know what’s next.</p>
<p>“Oh great! So in order to print something to the console in Haskell I need to use the <code>IO()</code> monad!”<br />
“Well, but what is a monad actually?”<br />
“A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, of course!”<br />
“Awesome, what is an endofunctor?”<br />
“It’s basically a functor from one category back to the same category”<br />
“Cool, and wtf is a functor?”<br />
“A functor is a map between categories”<br />
“…ok but wtf is a category actually”</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Maybe some developers doesn’t really care about that.<br />
But from my point of view, I feel “incomplete” without deeply understand what I’m doing.<br />
Ok, I can print a string to the console in Haskell, awesome. But why should I wrap it into a monad?<br />
Why is everything becoming so complicated?<br />
Every time I discover something new, a new world seems to appear in front of me, and I have to explore it.<br />
</p>
<p>This makes me feel so ignorant.<br />
And if I’m ignorant there’s no reason why I should work for X company.<br />
Other developers are way smarter than me, because they seems to know everything.<br />
I fear to loose my job because I’m not like the other developers.<br />
I’m doing something so easy, that everyone could do it.</p>
<p>These are some of the most common thoughts that a self taught developer can have when he/she’s stuck with a problem, when he/she discovers something new and unexpected, or just when they read some amazing blog posts or open source software from other developers.</p>
<p>That leads to the burnout, which I actually experienced once and has been terrible.<br />
I had to take two week of holidays because I didn’t want to code anymore.<br />
I deleted most of my local repositories (thanks <del>God</del> <strong>Linus</strong> there’s Git), I didn’t touch my computer for days and I just wanted to quit my job.<br />
On the other hand, I also feared to loose my job because of my incompetence and my inability to get out of this bad situation.</p>
<p>That has been quite terrifying.</p>
<p>I think that impostor syndrome is something that many developers are facing every day (even the CS-degreed ones), and I know that sometimes I can go a little overboard.<br />
Computer Science is a very competitive field, and I’m sure that I’m not the only one experiencing this.</p>
<p>By the way, there’s something I didn’t mentioned yet in this post.<br />
I may seem a bit critic about the software development industry, but that’s not the purpose of this blog article.<br />
Software development is a really complex job that can give great satisfactions to the ones that are doing it with passion.<br />
Every time that I feel frustrated I try to look back and see how many things I did and how much I enjoyed doing them.<br />
I can’t see myself doing another job.</p>
<p>I love to create things with code, ’cause code is freedom.</p>
